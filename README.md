# School_District_Analysis
## Overview of School District Analysis
#### The purpose of this project is to help Maria conduct an analysis on a given school district. Along with providing her with a summary on the schools spending, overall math and reading scores, and a compiled list of the highest performing schools and the lowest performing schools, Maria also asked that I manipulate the data by removing certain grade levels from the data and seeing how it changes the overall performance of the schools. In this document, we will compare and contrast the data from the module to the data we obtained through this project. 
## Results
#### - How is the district summary affected?
####   The only difference between the old analysis and the new analysis is how the math average decreased by 0.1% in the new analysis.

#### - How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
####   Thomas High School does worse when 9th grade scores are dropped from the original data. 
#### - How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
####    - Math and reading scores by grade
####      Other grade levels are not individually affected by the 9th grade scores being dropped; however, since the 9th graders scored well, dropping their scores affected the overall passing percentage from 90.95% to 90.63%.
####    - Scores by school spending
####      There was only a 0.08% decrease in the new analysis scores based on school spending. It dropped from 62.86% to 62.78%
####    - Scores by school size
####      There was only a 0.06% decrease in the new analysis scores based on school size. It dropped from 90.62% to 90.56%
####    - Scores by school type
####      There was only a 0.04% decrease in the new analysis scores based on school type. It dropped from 90.43% to 90.39%
## Summary
#### In conclusion, we observed that a 0.08% decrease based on school spending, a 0.06% decrease based on school size, a 0.04% decrease based on school type, and a 0.32% decrease based on the overall performance of Thomas High School when the 9th grade statistics are removed from the original data. We can assume that the 9th graders performed better than any other grade levels in Thomas High School and were keeping the average high.
